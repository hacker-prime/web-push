# Web Push PHP 
 This contains both the Web Push PHP Library & Example.  The library can be referenced here https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push-php and the example can be referenced here https://github.com/Minishlink/web-push-php-example. Both are required to make it work. I've made use of this last year but haven't dealt with it in months so it took a while for everything to click back together. I remembered that both repositories are needed from a YouTube video that was published in 2021 which can be referenced here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4joJFZorK94&t=985s.
